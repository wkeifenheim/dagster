_Jobs_ are the main unit of execution and monitoring in Dagster. The core of a job is a _graph_ of ops - connected via data dependencies. Jobs can also contain [resources](/concepts/resources) and [configuration](/concepts/configuration/config-schema), which determine some of the behavior of those ops.

Ops are linked together by defining the dependencies between their inputs and outputs. An important difference between Dagster and other workflow systems is that, in Dagster, op dependencies are expressed as data dependencies, not just execution dependencies. This difference enables Dagster to support richer modeling of dependencies. Instead of merely ensuring that the order of execution is correct, dependencies in Dagster provide a variety of compile and run-time checks.

You can run a job in a variety of ways - in the Python process where it's defined, via the command line, from Dagit, or via a GraphQL API.

The [Dagit UI](/concepts/dagit/dagit) centers on jobs. Dagit makes it easy to view all the historical runs of each job in one place, as well as to manually kick off runs for a job.

You can define [schedules](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules) to execute jobs at fixed intervals or define [sensors](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors) to trigger jobs when external changes occur.

## Creating a job

### From scratch

The simplest way to create a job is to use the <PyObject object="job"/> decorator.

Within the decorated function body, you can use function calls to indicate the dependency structure between the ops/graphs. In this example, the `add_one` op depends on the `return_five` op's output. Because this data dependency exists, the `add_one` op executes after `return_five` runs successfully and emits the required output.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/simple_job.py
from dagster import job, op


@op
def return_five():
    return 5


@op
def add_one(arg):
    return arg + 1


@job
def do_stuff():
    add_one(return_five())
```

When a defining job, you can provide [resources](/concepts/resources), [configuration](/concepts/configuration/config-schema), [hooks](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/op-hooks), tags, and an [executor](/deployment/executors) (follow the links for explanation of how to use each of these).

### From a graph

Dagster is built around the observation that any data DAG typically contains a logical core of data transformation, which is reusable across a set of environments (e.g. prod, local, staging) or scenarios. The graph usually needs to be "customized" for each environment, by plugging in configuration and services that are specific to that environment.

You can model this by building multiple jobs that use the same underlying graph of ops. The graph represents the logical core of data transformation, and the configuration and resources on each job customize the behavior of that job for its environment.

To do this, you first define a graph with the <PyObject object="graph" decorator /> decorator.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/jobs_from_graphs.py startafter=start_define_graph endbefore=end_define_graph
from dagster import graph, op


@op(required_resource_keys={"server"})
def interact_with_server(context):
    context.resources.server.ping_server()


@graph
def do_stuff():
    interact_with_server()
```

Then you build jobs from it using the <PyObject object="GraphDefinition" method="to_job" /> method:

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/jobs_from_graphs.py startafter=start_define_jobs endbefore=end_define_jobs
from dagster import ResourceDefinition

prod_server = ResourceDefinition.mock_resource()
local_server = ResourceDefinition.mock_resource()

prod_job = do_stuff.to_job(resource_defs={"server": prod_server})
local_job = do_stuff.to_job(resource_defs={"local": local_server})
```

`to_job` accepts the same arguments as the <PyObject object="job" decorator /> decorator: you can provide [resources](/concepts/resources), [configuration](/concepts/configuration/config-schema), [hooks](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/op-hooks), tags, and an [executor](/deployment/executors).

## Including a job in a repository

You make jobs available to Dagit, GraphQLs, and the command line by including them inside [repositories](/concepts/repositories-workspaces/repositories). If you include schedules or sensors in a repository, the repository will automatically include jobs that those schedules or sensors target.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/repo_with_job.py
from dagster import repository

from .jobs import do_it_all


@repository
def my_repo():
    return [do_it_all]
```

## Advanced job configuration

Ops and resources often accept [configuration](/concepts/configuration/config-schema) that determines how they behave. By default, you supply configuration for these ops and resources at the time you launch the job.

When constructing a job, you can customize how that configuration will be satisfied, by passing a value to the `config` parameter of the <PyObject object="GraphDefinition" method="to_job" /> method or the <PyObject object="job" decorator /> decorator. The options are discussed below:

### Hardcoded configuration

You can supply a config dictionary. The supplied dictionary will be used to configure the job whenever the job is launched. It will show up in the Dagit Launchpad and can be overridden.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/jobs_with_default_config.py
from dagster import job, op


@op(config_schema={"config_param": str})
def do_something(context):
    context.log.info("config_param: " + context.op_config["config_param"])


default_config = {"ops": {"do_something": {"config": {"config_param": "stuff"}}}}


@job(config=default_config)
def do_it_all_with_default_config():
    do_something()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Will log "config_param: stuff"
    do_it_all_with_default_config.execute_in_process()
```

### Partitioned jobs

You can supply a <PyObject object="PartitionedConfig" />. It defines a discrete set of "partitions", along with a function for generating config for a partition. You can configure a job run by selecting a partition.

For more information on how this works, take a look at the [Partitions concept page](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/partitions).

### Config mapping

You can supply a <PyObject object="ConfigMapping" />. This allows you to expose a narrower config interface to your job. Instead of needing to configure every op and resource individually when launching the job, you can supply a smaller number of values to the outer config, and the <PyObject object="ConfigMapping" /> can translate it into config for all the job's ops and resources.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/jobs_with_config_mapping.py
from dagster import config_mapping, job, op


@op(config_schema={"config_param": str})
def do_something(context):
    context.log.info("config_param: " + context.op_config["config_param"])


@config_mapping(config_schema={"simplified_param": str})
def simplified_config(val):
    return {"ops": {"do_something": {"config": {"config_param": val["simplified_param"]}}}}


@job(config=simplified_config)
def do_it_all_with_simplified_config():
    do_something()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Will log "config_param: stuff"
    do_it_all_with_simplified_config.execute_in_process(run_config={"simplified_param": "stuff"})
```

## Examples

This section covers a few basic patterns you can use to build more complex graphs and jobs.

### Linear Dependencies

The simplest graph structure is the linear graph. We return one output from the root op, and pass along data through single inputs and outputs.

src="/images/concepts/pipelines/linear.png"

/>

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/linear_pipeline.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker
from dagster import job, op


@op
def return_one(context) -> int:
    return 1


@op
def add_one(context, number: int) -> int:
    return number + 1


@job
def linear():
    add_one(add_one(add_one(return_one())))
```

### Multiple Inputs

<Image
alt="Multiple Inputs"
src="/images/concepts/pipelines/multi-inputs.png"
width={1000}
height={250}
/>

A single output can be passed to multiple inputs on downstream ops. In this example, the output from the first op is passed to two different ops. The outputs of those ops are combined and passed to the final op.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/multiple_io_pipeline.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker
from dagster import job, op


@op
def return_one(context) -> int:
    return 1


@op
def add_one(context, number: int):
    return number + 1


@op
def adder(context, a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b


@job
def inputs_and_outputs():
    value = return_one()
    a = add_one(value)
    b = add_one(value)
    adder(a, b)
```

### Conditional Branching

<Image

src="/images/concepts/pipelines/conditional.png"
width={1000}
height={250}
/>

<!-- visual: https://excalidraw.com/#json=6007093500837888,QdGSxQO6qRgaMZwJIGSyMA -->

An op only starts to execute once all of its inputs have been resolved. We can use this behavior to model conditional execution of ops.

In this example, the `branching_op` outputs either the `branch_1` result or `branch_2` result. Since op execution is skipped for ops that have unresolved inputs, only one of the downstream ops will execute.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/branching_pipeline.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker
import random

from dagster import Out, Output, job, op


@op(out={"branch_1": Out(is_required=False), "branch_2": Out(is_required=False)})
def branching_op():
    num = random.randint(0, 1)
    if num == 0:
        yield Output(1, "branch_1")
    else:
        yield Output(2, "branch_2")


@op
def branch_1_op(_input):
    pass


@op
def branch_2_op(_input):
    pass


@job
def branching():
    branch_1, branch_2 = branching_op()
    branch_1_op(branch_1)
    branch_2_op(branch_2)
```

### Fixed Fan-in

<Image
alt="Fixed Fan-in"
src="/images/concepts/pipelines/fixed-fan-in.png"
width={1000}
height={250}
/>

If you have a fixed set of op that all return the same output type, you can collect all the outputs into a list and pass them into a single downstream op.

The downstream op executes only if all of the outputs were successfully created by the upstream op.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/fan_in_pipeline.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker
from typing import List

from dagster import job, op


@op
def return_one() -> int:
    return 1


@op
def sum_fan_in(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(nums)


@job
def fan_in():
    fan_outs = []
    for i in range(0, 10):
        fan_outs.append(return_one.alias(f"return_one_{i}")())
    sum_fan_in(fan_outs)
```

In this example, we have 10 op that all output the number `1`. The `sum_fan_in` op takes all of these outputs as a list and sums them.

### Dynamic Mapping & Collect

In most cases, the structure of a graph is pre-determined before execution. Dagster also has support for creating graphs where the final structure is not determined until run-time. This is useful for graph structures where you want to execute a separate instance of an op for each entry in a certain output.

In this example, we have an op `files_in_directory` that defines a <PyObject object="DynamicOut" />. We `map` over the dynamic output which will cause the downstream dependencies to be cloned for each <PyObject object="DynamicOutput" /> that is yielded. The downstream copies can be identified by the `mapping_key` supplied to <PyObject object="DynamicOutput"/>. Once that's all complete, we `collect` over the results of `process_file` and pass that in to `summarize_directory`.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/dynamic_pipeline/dynamic_pipeline.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker
import os
from typing import List

from dagster import DynamicOut, DynamicOutput, Field, job, op
from dagster.utils import file_relative_path


@op(
    config_schema={"path": Field(str, default_value=file_relative_path(__file__, "sample"))},
    out=DynamicOut(str),
)
def files_in_directory(context):
    path = context.op_config["path"]
    dirname, _, filenames = next(os.walk(path))
    for file in filenames:
        yield DynamicOutput(
            value=os.path.join(dirname, file),
            # create a mapping key from the file name
            mapping_key=file.replace(".", "_").replace("-", "_"),
        )


@op
def process_file(path: str) -> int:
    # simple example of calculating size
    return os.path.getsize(path)


@op
def summarize_directory(sizes: List[int]) -> int:
    # simple example of totalling sizes
    return sum(sizes)


@job
def process_directory():
    file_results = files_in_directory().map(process_file)
    summarize_directory(file_results.collect())
```

### Order-based Dependencies (Nothing dependencies)

Dependencies in Dagster are primarily _data dependencies_. Using data dependencies means each input of an op depends on the output of an upstream op.

If you have an op, say `Op A`, that does not depend on any outputs of another op, say `Op B`, there theoretically shouldn't be a reason for `Op A` to run after `Op B`. In most cases, these two ops should be parallelizable. However, there are some cases where an explicit ordering is required, but it doesn't make sense to pass data through inputs and outputs to model the dependency.

If you need to model an explicit ordering dependency, you can use the <PyObject object="Nothing"/> Dagster type on the input definition of the downstream op. This type specifies that you are passing "nothing" via Dagster between the ops, while still uses inputs and outputs to model the dependency between the two ops.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/order_based_dependency_pipeline.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker
from dagster import In, Nothing, job, op


@op
def create_table_1():
    get_database_connection().execute("create table_1 as select * from some_source_table")


@op(ins={"start": In(Nothing)})
def create_table_2():
    get_database_connection().execute("create table_2 as select * from table_1")


@job
def nothing_dependency():
    create_table_2(start=create_table_1())
```

In this example, `create_table_2` has an input of type `Nothing` meaning that it doesn't expect any data to be provided by the upstream op. This lets us connect them in the graph definition so that `create_table_2` executes only after `create_table_1` successfully executes.

`Nothing` type inputs do not have a corresponding parameter in the function since there is no data to pass. When connecting the dependencies, it is recommended to use keyword args to prevent mix-ups with other positional inputs.

Note that in most cases, it is usually possible to pass some data dependency. In the example above, even though we probably don't want to pass the table data itself between the ops, we could pass table pointers. For example, `create_table_1` could return a `table_pointer` output of type `str` with a value of `table_1`, and this table name can be used in `create_table_2` to more accurately model the data dependency.

Dagster also provides more advanced abstractions to handle dependencies and IO. If you find that you are finding it difficult to model data dependencies when using external storages, check out [IOManagers](/concepts/io-management/io-managers).

### Using the Same Op Twice

You can use the same op definition multiple times in the same graph/job.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/pipelines.py startafter=start_multiple_usage_pipeline endbefore=end_multiple_usage_pipeline
@job
def multiple_usage():
    add_one(add_one(return_one()))
```

To differentiate between the two invocations of `add_one`, Dagster automatically aliases the op names to be `add_one` and `add_one_2`.

You can also manually define the alias by using the `.alias` method on the op invocation.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/pipelines.py startafter=start_alias_pipeline endbefore=end_alias_pipeline
@job
def alias():
    add_one.alias("second_addition")(add_one(return_one()))
```

## Patterns

### Constructing GraphDefinitions

You may run into a situation where you need to programmatically construct the dependencies for a graph. In that case, you can directly define the <PyObject module="dagster" object="GraphDefinition"/> object.

To construct a GraphDefinition, you need to pass the constructor a graph name, a list of op or graph definitions, and a dictionary defining the dependency structure. The dependency structure declares the dependencies of each op’s inputs on the outputs of other ops in the graph. The top-level keys of the dependency dictionary are the string names of ops or graphs. If you are using op aliases, be sure to use the aliased name. Values of the top-level keys are also dictionary, which maps input names to a <PyObject object="DependencyDefinition"/>.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/pipelines.py startafter=start_pipeline_definition_marker endbefore=end_pipeline_definition_marker
one_plus_one_from_constructor = GraphDefinition(
    name="one_plus_one",
    node_defs=[return_one, add_one],
    dependencies={"add_one": {"number": DependencyDefinition("return_one")}},
).to_job()
```

### Graph DSL

Sometimes you may want to construct the dependencies of a graph definition from a YAML file or similar. This is useful when migrating to Dagster from other workflow systems.

For example, you can have a YAML like this:

```YAML file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/my_graph.yaml
name: some_example
description: blah blah blah
ops:
  - def: add_one
    alias: A
  - def: add_one
    alias: B
    deps:
      num:
        op: A
  - def: add_two
    alias: C
    deps:
      num:
        op: A
  - def: subtract
    deps:
      left:
        op: B
      right:
        op: C
```

You can programmatically generate a GraphDefinition from this YAML:

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/dep_dsl.py
import os

from dagster import DependencyDefinition, GraphDefinition, NodeInvocation, op
from dagster.utils.yaml_utils import load_yaml_from_path


@op
def add_one(num: int) -> int:
    return num + 1


@op
def add_two(num: int) -> int:
    return num + 2


@op
def subtract(left: int, right: int) -> int:
    return left + right


def construct_graph_with_yaml(yaml_file, op_defs) -> GraphDefinition:
    yaml_data = load_yaml_from_path(yaml_file)

    deps = {}

    for op_yaml_data in yaml_data["ops"]:
        def_name = op_yaml_data["def"]
        alias = op_yaml_data.get("alias", def_name)
        op_deps_entry = {}
        for input_name, input_data in op_yaml_data.get("deps", {}).items():
            op_deps_entry[input_name] = DependencyDefinition(
                solid=input_data["op"], output=input_data.get("output", "result")
            )
        deps[NodeInvocation(name=def_name, alias=alias)] = op_deps_entry

    return GraphDefinition(
        name=yaml_data["name"],
        description=yaml_data.get("description"),
        node_defs=op_defs,
        dependencies=deps,
    )


def define_dep_dsl_graph() -> GraphDefinition:
    path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "my_graph.yaml")
    return construct_graph_with_yaml(path, [add_one, add_two, subtract])
```
